# TC-not-rivers
Code written by E. Skevington, used in the production of the paper lead by S. Fukuda on the differences in energetics between fluvial and gravity current systems.

The folder PLSQ contains general functions for performing a parametric polynomial least squares fit to a dataset.

The folder Data contains the datasets.

The script Produce_Fit runs a fit over the selected dataset. 
The file contains three options for computing data fits, one for fluvial, and two for gravity currents. 
The desired option can be selected by commenting/uncommenting portions of the code.
